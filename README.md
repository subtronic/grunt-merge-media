# grunt-merge-media

> Merges duplicate media queries into one rule, appended to the bottom of your stylesheet. This allows you to write your media queries "inline" but still combine them into one rule to avoid code duplication.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-merge-media --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-merge-media');
```

## The "merge_media" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `merge_media` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
	merge_media: {
		options: {
			// Task-specific options go here.
		},
		your_target: {
			// Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
		},
	},
});
```

### Options

#### options.compress
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

A Boolean value that will switch the compression of the processed file. This is passed straight into the `stringify` method in [css](https://github.com/reworkcss/css).

#### options.logFile
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

When set to `true`, a log file with details of the merge will be created in the working directory.

### Usage Examples

```js
grunt.initConfig({
	merge_media: {
		options: {
			compress: true,
			logFile: true
		},
		files: {
			{'src': 'styles/base.css', 'dest' : 'build/css/base.min.css'}
		},
	}
});
```

If the file destination is a folder, the stylesheet will be created in that folder with the same name as the original. Otherwise, it will be created in the exact path specified.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
